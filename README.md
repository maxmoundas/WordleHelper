# Wordle Helper

A Python script to assist players in narrowing down word possibilities in the game Wordle.

## Overview

Wordle is a game where you guess a 5-letter word and are given limited feedback to help pinpoint the word. This WordleHelper script helps you by narrowing down potential words based on the information you provide. Input the letters you know are in the word (but not their exact position), the spots where they definitely aren't located, and any characters that you've confirmed aren't in the word. The script will then list all potential words that fit your criteria.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- NLTK library

### Installing Dependencies

You need the NLTK library and the 'words' dataset to run the script. Install them using the following:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

Good luck with the daily Wordle!
